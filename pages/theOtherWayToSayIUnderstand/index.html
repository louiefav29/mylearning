            When You Understand the Literal Meaning:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="two">
            Sometimes you need a quick way to show that you understand what
            someone just said to you, without expressing any opinions on this.
            You can do that by saying: <span> OK / Alright / Sure </span> When
            somebody is explaining something to you, or asking you to do
            something, replying to them with one of these words is a polite way
            to show that you are listening and can follow what they are saying.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="three">
            <span>Got it. </span>
            This is another way of saying “ok, I understood what you said / what
            you want from me!”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="four">
            <span>OK, I get it now / That’s clear, thank you. </span>
            If you had trouble understanding someone the first time round but
            now it is clear, these phrases are very useful.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="one">When You Understand Someone’s Opinion:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="five">
            <span
              >Fair enough / I see where you’re coming from / I take your point
              / That makes sense.
            </span>
            These are all polite ways to show that you understand and respect
            someone’s opinion, without having to say if you agree with them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="six">
            <span>Of course / Absolutely. </span>
            Use these phrases to show that you not only understand what someone
            is saying, you also agree with them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="seven">
            <span>I appreciate why you think that, but… </span>
            This is a polite way to show that you understand the person’s point,
            but you don’t agree with it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="eight">
            <span>I hear what you’re saying, but… </span>
            This is very similar to the previous, but by saying ‘I hear’ you
            show that you are really listening and trying to see things from
            their point of view, too.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="one">
            When You Understand Someone’s Feelings:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="nine">
            <span>That’s totally fair / I don’t blame you. </span>
            These are both good ways to reassure someone that you understand
            their feelings and point of view, especially if they are angry or
            upset about something.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="ten">
            <span>I know what you mean. </span>
            This goes a step further by suggesting that you feel the same / have
            had a similar experience, so you really understand their feelings.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p class="slide" name="eleven">
            <span>I would feel the same. </span>
            This show the person that, even though you haven’t experienced the
            same thing, you understand their emotions and you would react in the
            same way if you did.
